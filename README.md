# 2d-collision-simulation


When the user activates the program, a user-menu will offer the user 3 options.
First option: A standard mini cubes collision simlation, this simulation also allows the user to control the colors of the simulation itself.

Second options: A mini cube collision simulation that highlights each collision. When a collision occurs, the color of the cube switches from green to red.
When all the cubes collided, the simulation will be over and the program will return the total time it took for all the cubes to collide.
Note: In the first 5 seconds of the simulations, no collisions are registered.


Third option: a spinning 2d simulation.
